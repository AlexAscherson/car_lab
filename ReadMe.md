# Prototype Body Shop

The goal of this homework is to get you comfortable with writing and implementing prototypes and constructors. It will also introduce testing.


1. Fork the repository
2. Clone and `cd` into the car_lab folder
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm test`

* Read the output to the terminal carefully!

* Open the folder in sublime and navigate to /spec/test.js and /src/car.js.

* Write code in car.js to make any failing tests pass.

* Once all tests are either passed or pending, go into test.js and search the file for the first instance of "xit". Delete the "x" (change "xit" to "it") and run `npm test` again. Repeat until all 14 tests pass!

## Extension

Write a test for parking the car then make it pass.  (Hint: What happens to the state of the car when you park?  What usually happens to passengers when a car is parked?)
